## Introduction

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can gain a high-level understanding of digital images or videos. It involves various techniques to analyze, process, and interpret visual data. This repository aims to showcase experiments in computer vision, providing insights into different algorithms, libraries, and techniques commonly used in the field.

## Experiments
