## Introduction

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can gain a high-level understanding of digital images or videos. It involves various techniques to analyze, process, and interpret visual data. This repository aims to showcase experiments in computer vision, providing insights into different algorithms, libraries, and techniques commonly used in the field.

## Experiments

Here are the experiments included in this repository:

1. Experiment 1: Canny Edge Detection and Morphological Operations - An experiment that demonstrates the effects of Canny edge detection and morphological operations on image processing and object detection.


## Getting Started

To run the experiments or explore the projects, you can access the experiment notebooks directly in Google Colab. Simply click on the experiment links above, and you will be redirected to the respective Colab notebooks.

## Results and Conclusions

Each experiment's results and conclusions can be found in their respective Colab notebooks. We have documented our findings, observations, and any insights gained during the experiments. Feel free to explore the experiment notebooks for detailed explanations.
